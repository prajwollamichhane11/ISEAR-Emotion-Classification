## About the New System/Product

**Q1. What are the needs of the software? Why is this kind of software necessary?**

The primary needs of the software is to maintain overall progress of an organisation. In an organization, an employee is always the first priority. If he/she is happy with work then overall progress of an organization is achieved. This kind of software helps in the study of the employees individuality, his/her moral, how he or she is satisfied with the company and much more. This is why we need such software inorder to build a profitable organisation with satisfied employees.

**Q2. What benefits do these software provide to an employee or an organisation?**

The main aim of this software is to study the employees behaviour. By studying their behaviour, the managerial body will know what an employee expects from the company and what is the reason for their dissatisfaction. In this way the managerial body can take necessary in fulfilling the valid wishes of the employees eventually benefitting the employees.

**Q3. What should be the top priority?**

The top priority should always be how we can make the employees happy and sustain them inside the company.

**Q4. What are the existing softwares in the market and what services do they provide?**

There is no such similar commercial softwares however several techniques like feedback forms, questionnaires, one to one meetings and sentiment analysis and much more are used to inspect the employees morale in a company.

**Q5. How will you and your organisation be benefited from this new system?**

As we already discussed how the employees are going to be benefitted. When the employees are benefited they show willingness to work. They respect their work and try to obtain better results. Overally, the organisation is what gets benefitted as a whole.

**Q6. Do you have any acceptance criteria? If any, what are they?**

The acceptance criteria is basically the correct prediction the software makes when tested on several sample cases. Moreover, we are also thinking of inspecting the performance after every 3 months and regularly improving the model. In such cases too, we regularly inspect the company’s performance too. But, majorly we will check how many employees have left the company, how is the employee’s performance (improved or constant) and how is the overall productivity of the company in the timestamp of 3 months and improve the model constantly.


## System Usage

**Q1. Who will be the users to the system ?**

The users to the system will be an organisation however mostly used by the managerial boards. 

## About the Data

**Q1. How do you obtain the data? In which format do we store before we operate them?**

The major source of the data is the employee’s conversation on the office platform. For example: there are provisions of several APIs provided by the platforms like SLACK, Workplace that can be used to inspect the employee’s messages. These messages will be stored in the online database systems like Firebase. We store these data on json formats.

**Q2. Do you have any data team? If any please tell how we can contact him/her?**

Yes, we have 2 data teams who will be working on this project. They are:
**Prajwol :** prajwollamichhane11@gmail.com
**Khusi:** shresthakhusi@gmail.com

**Q3. What is the main problem regarding data ?**

The main problem regarding the data is probably the amount of data. For a machine learning model data is said to be never enough. We have only 3000 samples for each of the emotions we will predict. And, moreover the data has only 7 sets of emotions which is also not enough because humans express emotions like surprise, sarcasms and much more.


## Caveats

**Q1. Are there any emotions that we will be unable to distinguish?**

Yes, there are several emotions like Surprise and Sarcasm that we will not be able to distinguish because of the lack of training data. Also, when a person expresses double emotions like laugh cry then also this cannot be labelled to any particular emotion. 

**Q2. What can be the challenges for measuring the model performance?**

The main challenge that can occur is measuring the model performance. For example, if we deploy the model today, we can not visualize the result tomorrow, it takes time. We track the progress of an organisation regularly, employee’s performance each day on one side. And, track the overall performance of the 3 months time stamp on the other side. Using these two analyses, we measure the model performance. However, this is a hectic process thus is more challenging.



## General

**Q1. What is your estimated deadline for the project completion?**

The project will be completed in 2 weeks. In the case of legitimate problems, we can be flexible with time.
